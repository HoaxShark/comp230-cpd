# Weekly Reports

## Week One

This week I met the new team for the first time, they seem nice, I made effort ot be social and get to know them. The world pitches went fine, an issue i can see in myself when doing a pitch with a lot of prepared notes to read is my inability to read the notes and directly communicate with the people recieving the pitch. Although this would be easier with a monitor setup that didn't force you to turn away from the audience that can't be assumed. It might be better for me to spend more time practicing the pitch instead of just a couple of goes through it, giving myself a better recollection of the notes so I can provide eye contact more often throughout the picth. The rest of the week was just quick introductions to our new modules.

## Week Two

We started our group game prototype this week, there were a good amount of meetings with the team before hand. The team seems to spend a lot of time not getting anywhere, I find this pretty frustrating but acceptable. I will be making sure to try to lead the discussion towards productives communication when we get stuck on the same topic for too long.  A short falling of mine I noticed when I was unprepared for the ethics and professionalism lecture was forgetting to read some of the requested chapters. I'd thought I had written down what to do but didn't check this to remind myself. I've made a work section on my phone of apps i need to check at least daily, this will hopefully mean I won't miss notes for myself again.

## Week Three

For the second prototype we have been making a side scrolling beat em up. A lot of the time here has been spent making the mechanics of movement and punching, it hasn't left much time to show the interesting mechanics that were thought up. In hindsight for the prototype it could have been worthwhile to take an exisiting similar project and use that to show the unique mechanics that we were hoping to use. Two dealines were due this week, having made sure to put the time in earlier on than I would have last year, I ended up with a more relaxed working experience when it came to the deadline day. A lecture we had this week talked about using bad habits to enforce a better working practice, or even just healthier living. Although this was something I knew about before it's made me consider again how I could use this to improve myself.

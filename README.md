# Weekly Reports

## Week One

This week I met the new team for the first time, they seem nice, I made effort to be social and get to know them. The world pitches went fine, an issue i can see in myself when doing a pitch with a lot of prepared notes to read is my inability to read the notes and directly communicate with the people recieving the pitch. Although this would be easier with a monitor setup that didn't force you to turn away from the audience that can't be assumed. It might be better for me to spend more time practicing the pitch instead of just a couple of goes through it, giving myself a better recollection of the notes so I can provide eye contact more often throughout the picth. The rest of the week was just quick introductions to our new modules.

## Week Two

We started our group game prototype this week, there were a good amount of meetings with the team before hand. The team seems to spend a lot of time not getting anywhere, I find this pretty frustrating but acceptable. I will be making sure to try to lead the discussion towards productives communication when we get stuck on the same topic for too long.  A short falling of mine I noticed when I was unprepared for the ethics and professionalism lecture was forgetting to read some of the requested chapters. I'd thought I had written down what to do but didn't check this to remind myself. I've made a work section on my phone of apps i need to check at least daily, this will hopefully mean I won't miss notes for myself again.

## Week Three

For the second prototype we have been making a side scrolling beat em up. A lot of the time here has been spent making the mechanics of movement and punching, it hasn't left much time to show the interesting mechanics that were thought up. In hindsight for the prototype it could have been worthwhile to take an exisiting similar project and use that to show the unique mechanics that we were hoping to use. Two dealines were due this week, having made sure to put the time in earlier on than I would have last year, I ended up with a more relaxed working experience when it came to the deadline day. A lecture we had this week talked about using bad habits to enforce a better working practice, or even just healthier living. Although this was something I knew about before it's made me consider again how I could use this to improve myself.

## Week Four

I'm starting to understand the idea of dialogues a bit more now, it's become more interesting talking about issues relevant to the industry. The third prototype has come along ok but doesn't have quite the pull that our first one did so far.

## Week Five

We've had a peer review this week, though sometimes we get incredibly lack luster reviews from some peers the use of a good review has really started to show. We got to the dialogue relevant to my plan for the ethics report this week which was lovely to have some serious interest in the discussion.

## Week Six

I've been really enjoying working on my ethics essay it's a subject that I feel is important and worth talking about. I normally hate discussing ethics as they are such a difficult subject to really nail down, but through all the dialogues I have made a note to stay more open minded as I have only experienced my side of life.

## Week Seven

We had a lecture on lighting for the graphics section this week, its very important to the plan for my project was it was exciting to see this implemented.

## Week Eight

This week I've been focused on my VR project, its been nice to get more use out of the vive and has felt exciting to build something in a VR environment. There are lots of new things to consider when making a game in VR.

## Week Nine

This week has been fine, I don't really have anything to say about this one sadly, but it has passed and a new one begins.

## Week Ten

I'm very aware that the end of term looms over me, and so i have been working diligently to complete as much as possible, balancing my remaining projects with the group one is sometimes difficult but i make an effort to always stay involved and even help my peers with there work where possible.

## Week Eleven

Everything is coming together towards the end of the year, it's been a hard year but I've done well working towards my last CPD goals and its feels like its been a success. Most notably was the feedback for my ethics essay, I never imagined to do so well and it's felt very rewarding given the amount of hard work I put into it.

## Week Twelve

I've been working hard to get a lot done before the Christmas holidays as I am going to be away for a long time over the holiday with no ability to work, it's a shame to not be able to continue my work over the holidays but it's not worth giving up a great holiday!
